Hello everyone. Now I have made an e-commerce website to practice my skills: redux, styling and typescript. 

In my app, I use Redux/Toolkit for state management.

Material Ui for styling, and I've added a few more files for styling the elements.

Playing with Typescript has allowed me to see where I need to practice more for larger projects.

I used DUMMY_DATA for my products 

If someone has a review for me to help me with the project I will be happy for that don't be shy.
